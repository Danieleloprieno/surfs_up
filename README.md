## Overview
This analysis was conducted at the request of W. Avey in order to inform business decision making about retail surf shops and ice cream stores in Oahu.  This analayis aims to inform the year long viability of such enterprises by looking at historical temperature and precipitation data for two months;  one summer and one winter.

- While December on average is not much colder, there is wider variance in temperares as illustrated by the wider IQR range, and more days lie well below the monthly average than seen in June.

- In all, while the average temperatures in June and Dcember do not differ much, the weather is more consistently nice in the summer than it is in the winter, and the chances of experiencing less than ideal conditions are much higher in winter months than summer ones.

## Summary

- While Oahu experience days in the 70's year round, historical data shows that these days happen less consistetely in the winter than they occur in the summer, challenging the viablity of ice cream and surf shops year round.  

- Additional weather related queries can help illustrate the varaince in weather outcomes in the winter.  Take, for example, differences in precipiation.

December sees not only mucch higher rates of precipiation but again the variance in precipation outcomes throughout the month vary more than seen in June.  Taken together with teh temperature data, winter operations of ice cream and surf shops might warrent reduced hours for such reasons.
